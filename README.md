Text-to-speech (TTS) technology translates written text into spoken words, combining linguistic analysis and digital processing to mimic human speech. TTS technology is widely used to enhance accessibility for those with visual impairments or reading difficulties, support language learning, and improve user interactions in customer service through IVR systems and virtual assistants.

This project demonstrates how to build a text-to-speech application using BentoML, powered by [XTTS](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2), a voice generation model that lets you clone voices into different languages.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed Python 3.9+ and `pip`. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to learn more.
- You have a basic understanding of key concepts in BentoML, such as Services. We recommend you read [Quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/get-started/quickstart.html) first.
- (Optional) We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation for this project. See the [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for details.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoXTTS.git
cd BentoXTTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. Run¬†`bentoml¬†serve`¬†in your project directory to start the Service. You may also set the environment variable `COQUI_TTS_AGREED=1` to agree to the terms of Coqui TTS.

```python
$ COQUI_TOS_AGREED=1 bentoml serve .

2024-01-18T11:13:54+0800 [INFO] [cli] Starting production HTTP BentoServer from "service:XTTS" listening on http://localhost:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
/workspace/codes/examples/xtts/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/TTS/api.py:70: UserWarning: `gpu` will be deprecated. Please use `tts.to(device)` instead.
  warnings.warn("`gpu` will be deprecated. Please use `tts.to(device)` instead.")

```

The server is now active at¬†[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

CURL

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/synthesize' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "text": "It took me quite a long time to develop a voice and now that I have it I am not going to be silent.",
  "lang": "en"
}' -o output.wav
```

Python client

This client returns the audio file as a `Path` object. You can use it to access or process the file. See [Clients](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/clients.html) for details.

```python
import bentoml

with bentoml.SyncHTTPClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
        result = client.synthesize(
            text="It took me quite a long time to develop a voice and now that I have it I am not going to be silent.",
            lang="en"
        )
```

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), then run the following command to deploy it.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html).
